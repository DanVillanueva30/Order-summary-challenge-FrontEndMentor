## My process
  The first thing I did was analyze the different designs in order to start structuring the HTML code and then start with the mobile design.
  And finally I started to write the styles for each section of the document.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

  This project helped me put my knowledge into practice
  It was actually very easy to do, but still I learned a lot and gained more experience.

### Continued development

  I will keep taking on more challenges to be able to write better and more code, following good practices and trying new ways of doing things.
